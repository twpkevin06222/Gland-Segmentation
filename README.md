In this challenge, participants are encouraged to run their gland segmentation algorithms on images of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained slides, consisting of a variety of histologic grades. The dataset is provided together with ground truth annotations by expert pathologists. The participants are asked to develop and optimise their algorithms on the provided training dataset, and validate their algorithm on the test dataset.

## Structure
### CSV Files
`Grade.csv` is the original spreadsheet provided by the organiser. 

`data.csv` is the post-processed spreadsheet with additional information for dataloading. 

### Notebooks
`EDA.ipynb` provides description about data understanding, data analyses of the dataset. 

`dataloader.ipynb` provides description about the data loading pipeline for training data set and testing data set. This includes data augmentation and data preprocessing inside the data loader pipeline. 

`inference.ipynb` attempts to provide an overview about the model used, hyperparameters, metrics result and visualisation of the inputs. 

### Python Files
These files contains helper functions or module for visualisation, model traning, evaluation and metrics. 

`utils.py` contains utility functioons mainly for visualisation purpose and preprocessing functions. 

`metric.py` contains functions to calculate evaluation metrics, which includes, F1 score, Object Dice Score, Object Hausdorff Distance, Dice Score and Hausdorff Distance. This python file is adapted from repo by [Hans Pinckaers](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/neural-odes-segmentation) . 

`train.py` is the main python file for model training. The training runs are all recorded in `Weights & Biases` cloud storage.
